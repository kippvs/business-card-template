# Personal Business Card Template
![Card Front](/front_final.png?raw=true "Card Front")  
![Card Back](/back_final.png?raw=true "Card Back")  

These are the design templates for my personal business cards. The .ai Adobe Illustrator files are fully editable, so any element can be changed as you wish. Additionally, a template file is available for checking appropriate print margins as used by [Vistaprint.com](https://www.vistaprint.com/) (but should fit the requirements of any other print service, as well). 

[pro tip: Print services like Vistaprint.com commonly allow printing to the back of your card for an additional fee. That fee is further increased if you wish to print color to the back. The template files given here are greyscale for the front and color for the back. To save a few bucks, simply swap the front and back files, so that greyscale is printed to the back and your headshot photo is printed to the front.]
